# Dashboard Updates Test Guide

## Changes Made

### 1. **Dashboard Layout Fixed**

- User dashboard: Project Timeline and Messages widgets are now large (2x2) and positioned side by side on the top row
- Small widgets (Quick Actions, Documents, Meetings, Activity) are positioned below
- Admin dashboard: All Projects and Messages widgets are large on top, with smaller widgets below

### 2. **Admin Project Management**

- Admins now see all approved projects from all users in the "All Projects" widget
- Each project shows:
  - Project name
  - User name
  - Current stage
  - Overall progress percentage
- Projects are clickable - clicking opens a modal for timeline management

### 3. **Timeline Editing Modal**

Admins can:

- View all project stages (Discovery, Planning, Development, Delivery)
- Click edit button on any stage to modify:
  - Stage status (upcoming, current, completed)
  - Stage description
  - Progress percentage (for current stages)
  - Estimated completion date
- Changes are automatically saved to Firestore

### 4. **Real-Time Updates**

- When admin updates a project timeline, changes appear immediately on user dashboards
- Uses Firestore onSnapshot listeners for real-time synchronization
- No page refresh needed - updates appear live

## Testing Steps

### As Admin:

1. Log in with an admin account
2. Go to dashboard
3. Look for the "All Projects" widget (should be large, on top left)
4. Click on any project in the list
5. In the modal:
   - Click edit on a stage
   - Change status to "current"
   - Set progress to 50%
   - Save changes
6. Observe the project progress update in the widget

### As User:

1. Open another browser/incognito window
2. Log in as the user whose project was updated
3. Go to dashboard
4. Observe the Project Timeline widget
5. The stage and progress should update in real-time without refresh

## What to Verify

1. **Layout**:
   - ✅ Large widgets (Project/Messages) on top row
   - ✅ Small widgets below in a grid
   - ✅ Responsive on different screen sizes

2. **Admin Features**:
   - ✅ All approved projects visible
   - ✅ Projects are clickable
   - ✅ Modal opens with timeline stages
   - ✅ Edit functionality works
   - ✅ Changes save successfully

3. **Real-Time Sync**:
   - ✅ User sees updates immediately
   - ✅ Progress bars update
   - ✅ Stage status changes reflect
   - ✅ No refresh required

## Known Issues to Watch For

1. If no projects show up in admin view, check that quotes have status "approved"
2. If real-time updates don't work, check browser console for Firestore permission errors
3. The timeline data is stored in the `projectTimelines` collection, keyed by quote ID

## Next Steps

If everything works correctly:

1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Deploy to production
3. Monitor for any Firebase permission issues
4. Consider adding email notifications when project stages change
