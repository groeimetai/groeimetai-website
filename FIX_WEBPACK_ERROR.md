# Fix Webpack Runtime Error

## Steps to resolve:

1. **Stop your development server** (Ctrl+C in terminal)

2. **Clear all caches**:
```bash
rm -rf .next
rm -rf node_modules/.cache
```

3. **Restart the development server**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. **Hard refresh your browser**:
   - Chrome/Edge: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Firefox: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Safari: Cmd+Option+R

## What we changed:

- Used Next.js `dynamic` import to load the MessagesPageFirebase component
- Disabled SSR for this component to avoid hydration issues
- Added a loading state while the component loads

## If the error persists:

1. Check the browser console for more specific errors
2. Try deleting `node_modules` and reinstalling:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```

3. Make sure all Firebase services are properly initialized

The dynamic import should resolve the webpack "Cannot read properties of undefined" error by ensuring the component loads properly in the browser environment.
