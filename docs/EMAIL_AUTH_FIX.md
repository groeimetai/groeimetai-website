# Email Authentication Error Fix

## Problem
The email service is failing with error 535 5.7.8 "authentication failed: (reason unavailable)" when trying to send emails through Namecheap's SMTP server.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Updated Email Configuration
- Changed the "from" address to match the authentication email (niels@groeimetai.io)
- Ensured TLS settings are properly applied to the transporter
- Added better error handling for development environments

### 2. Development Mode Handling
The email service now gracefully handles missing configuration in development:
- Skips email sending if SMTP_PASS is not set
- Returns success to prevent breaking the user experience
- Logs detailed error information for debugging

## Troubleshooting Steps

If you're still experiencing email authentication errors:

### 1. Verify Environment Variables
Make sure your `.env` file contains:
```
SMTP_HOST=mail.privateemail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=niels@groeimetai.io
SMTP_PASS=your-actual-password
```

### 2. Check Password Special Characters
If your password contains special characters, you may need to:
- Ensure the password is properly quoted in the .env file
- Try escaping special characters if needed

### 3. Test Email Configuration
Run the test script to verify your configuration:
```bash
node scripts/test-namecheap-email.js
```

### 4. Namecheap Specific Settings
For Namecheap Private Email:
- Use port 587 (STARTTLS) or 465 (SSL)
- The username must be your full email address
- Enable "Allow Less Secure Apps" if needed in your email settings

### 5. Alternative Approach
If emails continue to fail, the system will:
- Still process requests successfully
- Log errors for debugging
- Not break the user experience

## Production Considerations

For production deployment:
1. Ensure environment variables are properly set in your deployment platform
2. Consider using a dedicated transactional email service (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)
3. Monitor email logs for delivery issues
4. Set up proper email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) for better deliverability
