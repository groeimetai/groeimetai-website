# Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Implementation Guide

This document describes the Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) implementation for GroeimetAI.

## Overview

The 2FA implementation uses Firebase Multi-Factor Authentication with Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) support. Users can enable 2FA using authenticator apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, or any TOTP-compatible app.

## Features Implemented

### 1. 2FA Setup in Settings

- **Location**: `/src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx` (Security Tab)
- **Features**:
  - Toggle to enable/disable 2FA
  - QR code generation for authenticator apps
  - Verification code input
  - Backup codes generation and display
  - Password confirmation for disabling 2FA

### 2. 2FA Service

- **Location**: `/src/services/twoFactorService.ts`
- **Functions**:
  - `checkStatus()`: Check if 2FA is enabled for a user
  - `startTotpEnrollment()`: Begin TOTP enrollment process
  - `generateQRCode()`: Generate QR code for authenticator apps
  - `completeTotpEnrollment()`: Complete enrollment with verification
  - `generateBackupCodes()`: Generate recovery codes
  - `verifyTotpCode()`: Verify TOTP during login
  - `disable2FA()`: Remove all 2FA methods
  - `storeBackupCodes()`: Store backup codes securely

### 3. Login Page 2FA Support

- **Location**: `/src/app/login/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - 2FA verification dialog
  - Error handling for MFA requirements
  - Seamless login flow with 2FA

### 4. Auth Context Updates

- **Location**: `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Handle MFA errors during login
  - Return MFA resolver for login page

### 5. Type Definitions

- **Location**: `/src/types/index.ts`
- **Added Types**:
  - `SecuritySettings` interface
  - `TrustedDevice` interface
  - Security field in `UserSettings`

## User Flow

### Enabling 2FA

1. User navigates to Settings → Security tab
2. Toggles "Two-Factor Authentication" switch
3. Scans QR code with authenticator app
4. Enters 6-digit verification code
5. Receives and saves backup codes
6. 2FA is now enabled

### Logging in with 2FA

1. User enters email and password
2. If 2FA is enabled, a verification dialog appears
3. User enters 6-digit code from authenticator app
4. Successfully logs in to dashboard

### Disabling 2FA

1. User navigates to Settings → Security tab
2. Toggles off "Two-Factor Authentication"
3. Enters account password for confirmation
4. 2FA is disabled

## Security Considerations

1. **Backup Codes**: Generated using cryptographically secure random generation
2. **Password Confirmation**: Required when disabling 2FA
3. **Re-authentication**: Required before making security changes
4. **Secure Storage**: Backup codes are stored in Firestore (should be encrypted in production)

## Firebase Configuration

The implementation uses Firebase Auth's built-in MFA support. No additional Firebase configuration is needed as MFA is enabled by default in Firebase Auth.

## Dependencies

- `firebase/auth`: Firebase Authentication with MFA support
- `qrcode`: QR code generation for authenticator apps
- `@types/qrcode`: TypeScript types for qrcode

## Testing

To test the 2FA implementation:

1. Create or use an existing user account
2. Navigate to Settings → Security
3. Enable 2FA and complete setup
4. Log out and log back in to test 2FA verification
5. Test disabling 2FA with password confirmation

## Future Enhancements

1. **SMS 2FA**: Add phone number verification as an alternative 2FA method
2. **Email 2FA**: Add email-based verification codes
3. **Remember Device**: Allow users to trust devices for a period
4. **Backup Code Management**: Allow regeneration of backup codes
5. **Security Keys**: Support for hardware security keys (WebAuthn)

## Important Notes

- Backup codes should be encrypted before storing in production
- Consider implementing rate limiting for 2FA verification attempts
- Add monitoring for failed 2FA attempts
- Implement secure backup code delivery (email/download)
- Add user education about 2FA importance and usage
