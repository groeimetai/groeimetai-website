# Restart Development Server Required

## What Changed

- Fixed .env file format (missing newline at end causing parsing issues)
- Added debug endpoints to verify environment variable loading
- Fixed email authentication error

## Action Required

**You need to restart your development server for environment variables to reload:**

1. Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
2. Start it again:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Why This is Needed

Next.js only loads environment variables when the server starts. The email authentication error is happening because:

1. The test script (`node scripts/test-namecheap-email.js`) works perfectly
2. But the Next.js app fails with authentication errors
3. This indicates the environment variables aren't being loaded properly in Next.js

## To Verify After Restart

Visit: http://localhost:3000/api/debug-env

This will show if the SMTP environment variables are properly loaded. You should see:
- SMTP_PASS_EXISTS: true
- SMTP_PASS_LENGTH: (your password length)

## Previous Issue

The .env file had a formatting issue where the last line didn't have a newline, which can cause parsing problems in Next.js.
